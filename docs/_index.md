Lokomotive is an open source Kubernetes distribution that ships pure upstream
Kubernetes.
It focuses on being minimal, easy to use, and secure by default.

Lokomotive is fully self-hosted and includes [Lokomotive
Components](./concepts/components) adding essential functionality for production
not shipped with upstream Kubernetes.
